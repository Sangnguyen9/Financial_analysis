## üìå Sql_programming_project

## üìå Overview
## Objectives
- Analyze regional business performance, resource efficiency, and capital usage through SQL programming and BI visualization using internal financial and operational data.
The goal is to identify high-performing regions, optimize human capital, and improve capital allocation strategies for long-term profitability.
- In addition, it also helps us assess the capabilities of employees in each region through the Area Sales Manager (ASM) to promote a culture of responsibility and continuous development among ASMs. By analyzing different aspects of financial performance across all network areas and ASM KPIs, we can gain insights to maintain performance and improve the capabilities of senior managers in the company
  
## Data Sources
Data is collected from various departments at the headquarters, including Sales and Operations, Accounting and ASM records.

-  File fact_txn_month_raw_data: Records the income and expenses incurred by the financial activities of the enterprise in the General Ledger.

-  File fact_kpi_month_raw_data: Records the final balance of card activities at the end of each month.

-  File fact_kpi_asm: raw data on ASM monthly sales performance.

## Output
The objective is to develop a comprehensive regional business performance analysis report and a thorough employee performance evaluation report. Furthermore, a dashboard will be established to facilitate the visualization and analysis of these insights, thereby enabling more effective data-driven decision-making and strategic planning.

‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ **SQL Programming** 

**Data Processing: Dbeaver + Postgresql**
 ### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Use Dbeaver to import into the database
 
- File fact_txn_month_raw_data

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create dimension tables by using PostgreSQL Data Definition Language (DDL)

- Table dim_province: Information about cities in each zone area
<img width="1474" height="615" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d0ac8e9b-f1b2-4d53-a45e-8c8f00d4132d" /> 

- Table dim_report_item: Information about the criteria of the report table
<img width="1457" height="619" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/596d37c0-21a5-4946-8cbe-83f22ca3ce09" />

- Use PL/SQL programming to create a report that runs for each month in 2023.
  
- By providing the YYYYMM parameter, the system can dynamically generate monthly reports by extracting relevant data from the fact tables and joining it with the pre-defined dimension tables. This automated process ensures consistency, reduces manual intervention, and allows for scalable reporting across different time periods with accurate and up-to-date information.

‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ **Power BI**: Power BI dashboard containing all visualizations and insights

**I connected Power BI to the PostgreSQL database using DirectQuery mode to retrieve and visualize the data, helping users gain a broader view of the report. [View more](Report_final.pdf)**

## üìå Conclusion

Through this personal project, I not only enhanced my SQL Programming abilities but also gained practical experience in structuring, storing, and accessing data efficiently. Additionally, I became more familiar with data visualization by connecting to a database and utilizing Power BI to present insights. Most importantly, the project deepened my understanding of how data analysis can support business growth. It enabled me to communicate key insights clearly and effectively, especially to decision-makers and management teams.

**As this is my first project, there may inevitably be some mistakes. I truly welcome any feedback or suggestions you may have‚Äîfeel free to reach out to me at hoangsang19980702@gmail.com.**
